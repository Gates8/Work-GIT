A couple of things to note for this script:
	* Open the file and edit $VIBPath. Change this to the VIB file that is stored on the datastore. You must unzip the vib and point it to the extracted 'metadata.zip'
	* Open the file and edit $VIHosts and point this to a text file that contains the FQDN of each host.
